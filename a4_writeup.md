# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?

Adding the handeling for valid moves and making it ask the player again for a valid move if the one they did input was already taken or otherwise not valid.



2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.

tic tac toe has a small enough amount of moves where you could probably just hardcode spesific moves. You could reduce the amount of board placements you would need with an algorithm that matches equivalent board positions with rotating the board.



3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.

the hardcoding of moves would mean that it would have 100% accuracy all the time because the given moves would always be the best move.
